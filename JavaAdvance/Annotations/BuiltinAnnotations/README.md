Built-In Java Annotations used in Java code
- `@Override`
- `@SuppressWarnings`
- `@Deprecated`


### @Override
`@Override` annotation assures that the subclass method is overriding the parent class method. If it is not so, compile time error occurs.

Sometimes, we does the silly mistake such as spelling mistakes etc. So, it is better to mark @Override annotation that provides assurity that method is overridden.

### @SuppressWarnings
`@SuppressWarnings` annotation: is used to suppress warnings issued by the compiler.


### @Deprecated Annotation
`@Deprecated` tells other developers that the marked element should no longer be used. It's common to also add some Javadoc next to the @Deprecated annotation to explain what would be a better alternative that serves the right behavior.
